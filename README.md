# Requirements

- Python with all the needed dependencies installed (see requirements.txt($ pip install -r requirements.txt))
- Bash (to be able to execute the .sh files, which make the usage a bit easier)
- The musicSetup.sh script will work on Linux and maybe on MacOS too

# Usage

If all the Requirements are fulfilled just execute "play.sh". 
If you cannot execute a .sh file because of your OS, go into Source/bin/ and execute the desired PySTK mode.
The rest should be self explenatory.

# Music

If you want to have music, just create a folder inside of Source named "Music".
Now you can put your music inside (mp3's should always work).
Then you can execute the script musicSetup.sh.
This will bring you to the code where you can modify the path to your music in order to get your it to work (Source/music.py)!
This only will work if you have NeoVim, Vim, Nano or Vscode/ium installed.
Let me know which editors you want to be added!
